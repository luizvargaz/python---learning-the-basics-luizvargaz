## Assignment 01: Python - Learning the Basics

### Lab Objectives

On completion of this lab, students will be able to:

1. Write a Python code that uses functions to resolve a set of simple tasks;
2. Properly document Python code using header and in-line comments;
3. Use the git code management system to track changes to your personal software; and
4. Submit assignments for grading through Gradescope.

### Reading Assignment

- [Think Python 2e](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/), Chapters 1-3
- Assignments at this point in the class are graded mostly on documentation, so read this answer to [How do I use comments effectively?]( https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=47221326) and review the sample code comments provided before submitting your assignment.

### The Lab Assignment

#### Getting Started

Instructions for getting started are specific to the course you are taking, so please check the Getting Started instructions on BrightSpace.

#### The first assignment

To demonstrate that you have read and understood these instructions and the materials in Think Python Chapters 1-3, you are asked to complete two exercises from the book.  For each assignment, a blank template file has been included for each of the exercises to be completed.  Open each with your preferred code editor (e.g., spyder), and complete the exercise following the embedded prompts and the exercise description.  The template code and prompts will make sure that your final code conforms to the format expected by the autograder - change the format and the autograder will fail your code even if it works for you.  You can submit your code to the autograder as many times as necessary to get full points (see the grading rubric), but make sure that you use the on-line discussion board for help if you do not understand the feedback from the autograder. 

1. **Think Python Chapter 3: Exercises 3.2** \[15 pts; do parts 1 through 5 and submit script for part 5 - "do_four"\]. 

   - Copy or rename the template **template_Exercise_3_2_do_four.py** to the submission name **Exercise_3_2_do_four.py**.  
   - Make all of your edits to this version of the code.
   - The template file includes guidance on how to structure the program, including what is to be passed and returned from each function.  This may differ from how the exercise is described in the textbook, but should be followed so that your code conforms to the expectations of the autograder.  
   - The name of the submission code must **exactly match** the name given above, or the autograder will fail to find and run the code.
   - **Note:** In earlier editions of  the Think Python book this problem was numbered Exercise 3.4, as activities within the chapter were also numbered and the first exercise at the end of the chapter was not numbered starting at 1.  
   
2. **Think Python Chapter 3: Exercise 3.3** \[15 pts; complete parts 1 and 2, and submit a script for part 2\]. 

   - Copy or rename the template **template_Exercise_3_3_4x4_grid.py** to the submission name **Exercise_3_3_4x4_grid.py**.  
   - Make all of your edits to this version of the code.
   - The template file includes guidance on how to structure the program, including what is to be passed and returned from each function.  This may differ from how the exercise is described in the textbook, but should be followed so that your code conforms to the expectations of the autograder.  
   - The name of the submission code must **exactly match** the name given above, or the autograder will fail to find and run the code.
   - **Note** In earlier editions of the Think Python book this was numbered Exercise 3.5, as activities within the chapter were also numbered and the first exercise at the end of the chapter was not numbered starting at 1.
      
#### What to turn in...

The following should be included in your GitHUB repository:

1. A working program called **Exercise_3_2_do_four.py**, which conforms to the template provided with the original repository.

2. A working program called **Exercise_3_3_4x4_grid.py**, which conforms to the template provided with the original repository.

3. Check your final scripts into the assignment repository and push to GitHUB. 

4. Use the provided link to submit the GitHUB repository to GradeScope.  The autograder will return a report on whether the submitted code met the performance checks.  If errors are found, fix the code, and resubmit.

#### Grading Rubric (50 pts Total)

| Question | Description | Score |
| -------- | ----------- | ----- |
| 1. | Write a Python script to complete Exercise 3.2 (part 5) | (15 pts) |
| 1.1. | - Function do_twice passes autograder | 3 pts |
| 1.2. | - Function print_twice passes autograder | 3 pts |
| 1.3. | - Function do_four passes autograder | 3 pts |
| 1.4. | - Program output is correct | 6 pts |
| 2. | Write a Python script to complete Exercise 3.3 | (15 pts) |
| 2.1. | - Function print_grid passes autograder | 9 pts |
| 2.2. | - Program output is correct | 6 pts |
| 3. | Programs should have clear and concise header comments | 5 pts |
| 4. | Programs should have clear and concise in-line comments | 5 pts |
| 5. | Programs were updated and changes stored in GitHUB repository for the assignment | 5 pts |
| 6. | Contents of GitHUB repository were uploaded to GradeScope for grading | 5 pts |

**Grading Notes:** Autograder points for this assignment are awarded if the function is called with the correct number of parameters, and the function call does not throw any errors.  Evaluation of the output is conducted manually, when comments are evalauted.
